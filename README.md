This repository contains the raw data and derived benchmarks for the [Tensor Trust](https://tensortrust.ai/paper) project. An interactive explanation of how to load and use the data (including the meaning of the columns) is in the Jupyter notebook called [`Using the Tensor Trust dataset.ipynb`](./Using the Tensor Trust dataset.ipynb`).  [Click here to run the notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HumanCompatibleAI/tensor-trust-data/blob/main/Using%20the%20Tensor%20Trust%20dataset.ipynb).
